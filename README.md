# Automated-whitefly-Eggs-Detection-and-Counting-using-Digital-Image-Processing
In this project, an image processing-based solution was investigated to automate the counting of whitefly eggs on leaves for the quantification of whitefly infestation on crops. To that effect, locally generated image dataset was used to devise an algorithm to count the whiteflies on the leaves of the cotton plant.
